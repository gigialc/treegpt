# TreeGPT

TreeGPT is a conversational AI tool that transforms how users interact with AI by enabling branching conversation paths. Powered by the OpenAI API, it allows users to revisit any previous message, create new branches to explore different discussion directions, navigate conversations with hotkeys, and visualize discussions as a tree. The application combines a familiar chat interface with a powerful tree-based structure for brainstorming, planning, and troubleshooting.

## Status

This project is under active development. This repository contains the initial project structure, with further phases to implement the backend, frontend, and core features.

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: Will contain the Next.js application for the user interface.
- `backend/`: Will contain the Node.js/Express.js server and MongoDB integration.
- `shared/`: Will contain shared resources like types or utilities.

Stay tuned for updates as TreeGPT grows!
